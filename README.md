This is an adaptation of my 'D3PDA' interface for EverQuest compatible with Project Quarm w/ Zeal.

# D3PDA
This started as a UI themed after the PDA in Doom 3 and evolved from there into something unique. This UI utilizes a few tricks that you don't see in other UIs to achieve it's unique file structure and layout features. This UI grew to such complexity that I wrote an overly simple generator program to handle generating the variations of files that only differ in what data they convey.

### What's included in the UI
* An re-skin of the default templates.
* Player window with an integrate stat sub-window.
* Group window.
* Spell Casting window with tinted spell slots, spell names, and integrated casting gauge.
* Target window.
* Buff window with variations for left and right aligned (see EQUI_BuffWindow.xml for details).
* Loot window with smaller items and more columns.
* Merchant window similar to the loot window.
* Spell gem and buff icons based on 90s cRPGs.
